# Project Requirements and Recommendations
In this section we discuss project requirements and recommendations. Many of the recommendations involve working on technologies that we're keen on developing and incubating for Movement!

## Requirements
For all hackathon participants, we expect...
- a pitch deck,
- a paper,
- links to source developed during the hackathon.
  
We've included templates for `LaTeX` and `PPT` in the `templates/presentation` folder. You will make five minute pitches using your deck at the end of the hackathon.

## Project recommendations
There are a variety of ways to use and contribute to the Movement ecosystem. These include dApp development, infrastructure development, bounties, and direct contributions to our software.

### dApps
The content of this course should have prepared you to work on dApps such as the following.
- Continue with ðŸ’» GimmeMini, `examples/movement/gimme_mini`
- Continue with ðŸ’» MiniDex, `examples/movement/mini_dex`.
- Create a mini oracle provider, rollup provider, or validator set management system. You may wish to continue from ðŸ’» NewsMoves `examples/movement/new_moves`
- Decentralized Twitter clone. You may fish to continue from ðŸ’» MyFirstDapp `examples/movement/my_first_dapp`.

### Infrastructure
We're all about continuing to build out the Movement ecosystem to empower more awesome developers like you. At the time of writing, the following are all things we have a close eye on.
- Connect a new wallet! Right now we only support [Pontem](https://pontem.network/) on testnet.
- Create an L2 that allows us to deposit levered funds in another protocol.
